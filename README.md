## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Index
Here you can find an empty ul and 4 section with id, data-nav and class i .

## App
The functionality of the code. 
1) The dynamically building of navigation bar with number of links which should equal to number of sections
2) when you click on any link in navigation bar it will take you to its section and both will change their back-ground color
3) there is a Top button for anytime you wanna get to the top of the page
4) when you scroll the page it will determine the active section with its active link by changing their back-ground color

## Styles
Most of the code here was taken from the main code provided by Udacity. I changed some colors to be easy to notice the active onces

## Running
To launch this website, simply clone the repo and open the `index.html` file in the browser.
